# StorageFactory---First-Smart-Contract
It contains my first smart contract called SimpleStorage, written using Solidity language to store ID's of people along with their name in Blockchain and retrieve the ID's by specifying their names. Also, implemented another contract called StorageFactory that controls the creation of previous smart contract and made to access the contracts.
